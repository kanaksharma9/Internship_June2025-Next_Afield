Internship Progress Repository
ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Getting Started
Welcome to my internship progress repository!

ðŸ”¹ What I Did on Day 1
âœ… Set up this Git repository to record all my daily tasks, learning notes, and code snippets.

âœ… Configured Git on my local machine and connected it to GitHub.

âœ… Created an organized folder structure for different tasks and projects Iâ€™ll work on during the internship.

âœ… Wrote this README.md to document the purpose and initial setup.

ðŸ”¹ Why I Created This Repo
ðŸ“‚ To track my daily progress in one place.

ðŸ“š To build a reference of what I learn each day.

ðŸ”„ To practice version control and collaborate effectively.

âœ¨ To stay consistent and accountable.
