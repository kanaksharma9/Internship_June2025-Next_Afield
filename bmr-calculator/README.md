# ðŸ§® BMR Calculator

This project was my first hands-on experience with **Svelte** â€” built as a fun way to understand how reactive frameworks work.

Itâ€™s a simple BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator where I explored:
- Component-based structure
- Reactive variables
- Event handling in Svelte

Just a small project to learn by doing! ðŸš€
