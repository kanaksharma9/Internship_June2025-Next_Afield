# ðŸ§® JavaScript Calculator

A fully functional calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project helped me practice:
- DOM manipulation
- Handling user inputs
- Building calculator logic for basic arithmetic operations (with parentheses and decimals)

Itâ€™s a fun little UI + logic combo â€” all in vanilla JS!
