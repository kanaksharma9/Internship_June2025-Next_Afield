Understanding of Full Stack Development
Full Stack Development involves working on both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of web applications. A full stack developer is responsible for designing user interfaces, handling server logic, managing databases, and ensuring smooth communication between all layers of the application. It requires knowledge of multiple technologies and the ability to build complete, scalable, and responsive web applications from end to end.

Technologies & Tools I Know
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Python

Database: MongoDB

Full Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Others: Git & GitHub, REST APIs

Learning Goals for This Internship
During this internship, my goal is to deepen my expertise in the MERN stack and explore additional frameworks and tools used in modern full stack development. I aim to work on real-world projects that challenge my current skills, improve my code quality, and expose me to best practices in software development. Ultimately, I want to grow into a more confident, versatile developer capable of building robust and scalable applications.

## JavaScript Revision Cheatsheet

### Basics

let x = 10;
const y = "Hello";
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let obj = { key: "value" };
let msg = `Hi ${y}`;

Control Flow
if (x > 5) { console.log("Big"); }
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }

Functions
function greet(name) { return `Hello, ${name}`; }
const greet2 = (name) => `Hi, ${name}`;

Arrays & Objects
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.map(x => x * 2);  // [2, 4, 6]

let user = { name: "Kanak", age: 21 };
const { name, age } = user;

ES6+ Features
const sum = (...nums) => nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
let arr2 = [...nums, 4];
